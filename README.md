Motiation for the project:

Can we determine a daily price for a new host that fits into its neighnourhood and competitors in Dublin?

Main focus is on the feautures and how a new host can make a good impression by post a picture of them, flexible stay, cancellation policy etc. 

##  Dataset

The orginal data dataset has 9143 rows and 10 columns

## Data processing

Lets put ourselves in the shoes of someone whos offering their home.  Fixed features of our property such as location, size, type of property, rooms. We also need to decide how we want to be listed: with or without picture, minimum nights, cancellation policy, number of people accepted. As we are conisdering first time host, we cannot be super host nor have previous reviews. Considering all these factor, we are ready with the selection of all the features to work with.
